# Overrides standard landing page
id: MLH intro landing FirstScreen
continue button field: MLH_intro_landing
question: |
  Welcome to ${ AL_ORGANIZATION_TITLE }’s ${ MLH_interview_short_title } tool
subquestion: |
  This tool will help you write a personalized letter to your landlord requesting **the return of your security deposit**.
  
  Use this tool if:
  
  * it has been more than **30 days** since you moved out of your old home,
  * you gave your previous landlord your **forwarding address** within **four days** of moving out of the home, 
  * you did **not** get your **security deposit** or **a list of damages** from your previous landlord, **and**
  * you have **not** gotten anything in writing explaining why your landlord kept some or all of your security deposit.

  ${ collapse_template(forwarding_address_template) }
  
  If you did **not** give your landlord your forwarding address within four days, the timelines in this letter do not apply and **you should not use this tool**. If that is the case, return to the [Michigan Legal Help website](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/housing/security-deposit-help-tenants) to learn more.
  
  Otherwise, click the **${MLH_continue_button_label}** button below.

id: MLH intro time
mandatory: False
question: Answer the questions to get your ${ MLH_form_type }
subquestion: |
  It should take you between 5 and 20 minutes to answer all the questions.
  
  Your personalized letter will be ready to print after you have answered all the questions. 
  
  % if MLH_instructions_included:
    You will also get a set of step-by-step instructions on what to do next with your letter.

  Getting ready
subquestion: |
  You will need this information to complete the tool: 
  
  * Your **contact** information (forwarding address, phone number, e-mail etc.);
  * If **your roommates or co-tenants** are signing this letter with you, you should have their **contact** information ready (name, address, phone number);
  * Your **landlord**'s name and **contact** information (name, address, phone number);
  * The **rental** address you moved out from; **and**
  * The **amount** of the deposit.

  You should be able to find all of this information on your lease agreement.

id: thirty days not passed
continue button field: thirty_days_not_passed
question: It has not been 30 days
subquestion: |
  This letter should only be used if you moved out more than 30 days ago.

  You can still use this tool now to create your letter, but **wait to send the letter until 30 days have gone by and your landlord has still not returned your security deposit or given you a list of damages.** 
  
  This means that you should not send your letter before ${ letter_date }.

template: forwarding_address_template
subject: |
  What is a forwarding address?
content: |
  A forwarding address is your **new address**. Within **four days** of moving out of your old home, you must give your landlord your **new address** in writing. If you don’t want to give your landlord your new address, you can provide a different forwarding address like a P.O. Box. If you do this, make sure you **regularly pick up** any mail sent to that address.

question: |
  You cannot use this tool
subquestion: |

If you don’t provide your new address, your landlord does not have to give you an itemized list of damages and they can keep your security deposit until you do something to get it back.
