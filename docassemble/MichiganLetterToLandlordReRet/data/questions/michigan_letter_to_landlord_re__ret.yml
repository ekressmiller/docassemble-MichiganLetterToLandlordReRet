  DIY Letter to Landlord (Security Deposit)
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you write a personalized letter to your landlord requesting **return of your security deposit**.

  * you gave your previous landlord your **forwarding address** within **four days** of moving out of the home and;
  
  * have **not** gotten your **security deposit** from your previous landlord and;
  
  * it’s been more than **30 days** since you moved out of your old home.

  ${ collapse_template(forwarding_address_template) }
  
  If you did **not** give your landlord your forwarding address within four days, the timelines in this letter do not apply and **you should not use this tool**.
