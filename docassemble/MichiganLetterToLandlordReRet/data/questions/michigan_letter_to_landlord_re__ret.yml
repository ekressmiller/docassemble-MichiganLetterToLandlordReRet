  * Date of birth
  * Social security or national identification number
  * Driver’s license or state identification number
  * Passport number
  * Financial account numbers

  **If a question doesn't specifically ask for personal identifying information, do not include it in your answers.** When this information is necessary, this tool will specifically ask for the information and it will go on a separate non-public form that you will file along with the other documents. This DIY tool will automatically produce that form if you need it.

  Do you understand that you should not enter any personal identifying information unless this tool specifically asks for it?

# Each attachment defines a key in an ALDocument. We use `i` as the placeholder here so the same
# template is used for "preview" and "final" keys, and logic in the template checks the value of 
# `i` to show or hide the user's signature
